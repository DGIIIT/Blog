## Github Information 
### Language on Github

How the language bot recognise what is in your repository (the colored bar on top of it) : [github-linguist](https://github.com/github/linguist/blob/master/lib/linguist/languages.yml)

Here is a cool website with all the languages used on github: [githut](http://githut.info/)

### Github API

Github has an API that can be use to develop scripts  or create application linked on it (the integrations below for example).
Here is the link to the API documentation : [github Developer](https://developer.github.com/v3/)

## Github Integration

### Documentation
#### GitBook
Available to write your own book on github: [https://www.gitbook.com/book/sylhare/manual/details](https://www.gitbook.com/book/sylhare/manual/details)
The view version is linked to my github url: [https://sylhare.gitbooks.io/manual](https://sylhare.gitbooks.io/manual)

### Code Reviews
#### Code Climate
IT will give a rating to you repository (pyhton, javascript, jave) based on general code rules (duplication of code, display, ...). A good way to improve your coding style.
Dashboard available here: [https://codeclimate.com/dashboard](https://codeclimate.com/dashboard)

### Automatic build
#### Travis CI
CI stands for Continuous integration
Automatic test and deploy: [https://travis-ci.org/](https://travis-ci.org/)
It can be configured through a `.travis.yml` file in the repository.

### Heroku
Heroku is a platform as a service (PaaS) that enables developers to build, run, and operate applications entirely in the cloud: 
[https://www.heroku.com/](https://www.heroku.com/)

### Perfomrance
#### Opbeat
JavaScript performance monitoring synch with deployment tool (heroku for example): [https://opbeat.com/](https://opbeat.com/)
There's some extra steps that will be necessary to do when making it available. I don't have active webapp so I can only have a limited use of it.
